Thanks for your interest on akarru.
If you want to make comments send them to admin@blogmemes.com

If you want to configurate akarru for your proyect you must change the conf files included on smarty/configs directory.
Almost all messages are there.
In future releases the localization of akarru will be enhanced.

You must configure your database connection and other parameters on config.php file.

You must install the last release of smarty template engine from: http://smarty.php.net/

Also you must use mysql 4.1+.
