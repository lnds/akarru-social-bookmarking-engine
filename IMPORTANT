IMPORTANT INFORMATION

RELEASE 0.4.4.120

The last release didn't handle the AES security in proper way.
The problem was fixed, we suggest to use your backups for a new password generation.

You can regenerate the passwords this way:

update users set password = aes_decode(strong_pass, md5(join_date));

then with your  global key, you must do:

update users set strong_pass = aes_encode(pass, md5(join_date)||'your secret key'));

Read the notes on release 0.4.4.100 or visit the trac site for more details.

RELEASE 0.4.4.100


UPGRADING DATABASE FOR BETTER SECURITY

With release 0.4.4.100 we have changed the password storage.

A new configuration parameter is in config.php

define('AES_KEY', '<put your secure key here>');/// AES site key for password storage

this parameter is used in users.php for registration and login.

With this, we abandon the MD5 passwords, and we store them in a more secure mode using AES.

If you have a working database and want to upgrade to release 0.4.4.100 you must execute this
script in mysql:


alter table users add strong_pass blob;
update users set strong_pass = aes_encrypt(password, md5(join_date || YOUR_AES_KEY));

after a while you can drop password from the table.

Remember to do a backup of your database!!.
